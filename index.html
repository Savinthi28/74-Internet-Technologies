    <h1>HTML</h1>

    <p>HTML, or HyperText Markup Language, is the essential backbone of every webpage, defining its structure. It uses "tags" to organize content like headings, paragraphs, images, and links, telling your browser how to display them. Crucially, HTML is not a programming language; it simply marks up and describes content, forming the static foundation for webpages.</p>
    
    <h3> Lessons </h3>
    <ul> 


    <li><strong>Text Sementics</strong></li>
     <p><blockquote>Text semantics in HTML refers to using elements that convey the <strong>meaning and purpose</strong> of content, 
        rather than just its visual presentation. Instead of relying solely on generic elements like <code>&lt;div&gt;</code> and 
        <code>&lt;strong&gt;</code> and styling them with CSS, semantic HTML utilizes tags such as <code>&lt;header&gt;</code>, 
        <code>&lt;nav&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;main&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;article&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;section&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;footer&gt;</code>, 
        <code>&lt;blockquote&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;strong&gt;</code>, and <code>&lt;em&gt;</code>. This approach offers several crucial benefits:</blockquote></p>
        <p>
            <ul>
                <blockquote>
                <li><strong>Accessibility:</strong> Semantic elements provide a clear structure that screen readers and other assistive technologies can interpret, enabling users with disabilities to navigate and understand content more effectively. For example, an <code>&lt;h1&gt;</code> tag explicitly tells a screen reader that its content is a top-level heading.</li>
                <li><strong>Search Engine Optimization (SEO):</strong> Search engines prioritize well-structured content that uses semantic elements correctly. This helps them better understand the context and hierarchy of information on a page, leading to improved search rankings.</li>
                <li><strong>Maintainability and Readability:</strong> Semantic HTML creates a more logically structured document that is easier for developers to read, understand, and maintain. It clearly indicates the role of each content block, reducing confusion and simplifying future updates.</li>
                <li><strong>Future Compatibility:</strong> By adhering to semantic principles, your HTML code is more likely to remain compatible with evolving web technologies and standards.</li>

        <li><strong>List</strong></li>
         <p><blockquote>This HTML code demonstrates the three main types of lists used on webpages, 
            each serving a distinct purpose for organizing information. First, the Unordered List <code>&lt;ul&gt;</code> displays
            items with bullet points, perfect for lists where the order doesn't matter (like a shopping list). 
            Second, the Ordered List <code>&lt;ol&gt;</code> presents items with numbered or lettered sequences, ideal when the order is important 
            (like steps in a recipe). Finally, the Definition List <code>&lt;dl&gt;</code> is used for terms and their corresponding descriptions. 
            Here, <code>&lt;dt&gt;</code> defines the "term" and <code>&lt;dd&gt;</code> provides its "description", making it great for glossaries or FAQs. Together, 
            these list types provide flexible ways to structure and present content clearly and logically in HTML.</blockquote></p>

        <li><strong>HyperLink</strong></li>
        <p><blockquote>This HTML code demonstrates the fundamental concept of hyperlinks, created using the anchor element <code>&lt;a&gt;</code>, 
            which are essential for navigation on the web. It showcases several ways to link to different destinations: 
            connecting to external web pages (like Google or Facebook), linking to internal web pages within the same project using both relative 
            paths (e.g., ./../exercises/exercises-2.html) and absolute paths (e.g., /exercises/exercises-1.html). Additionally, 
            it illustrates how to open links in a new browser tab (target="_blank") and how to create a "mailto" link to easily compose an email. 
            These variations highlight the versatility of the <code>&lt;a&gt;</code> tag in connecting users to content both within and outside a website.</blockquote></p>

        <li><strong>Media</strong></li>
        <p><blockquote>This HTML code demonstrates how to embed various media content directly into a webpage. It covers four main types:</blockquote></p>
        <ol>
            <li>Images <code>&lt;img&gt;</code> Shows how to display pictures using both local files (from your project folder) and external URLs. The src attribute points to the image location, style controls its size, and alt provides descriptive text for accessibility.</li>
            <li>Videos <code>&lt;video&gt;</code> Explains how to embed video files, again using both local and external sources. The src attribute links to the video, style sets dimensions, and the controls attribute adds built-in play, pause, and volume controls.</li>
            <li>Audios <code>&lt;audio&gt;</code> Illustrates embedding audio files. Similar to video, src specifies the audio file, and controls provides standard playback options.</li>
            <li>Iframes <code>&lt;iframe&gt;</code> Shows how to embed content from another website directly into your page. The src attribute contains the URL of the content to embed, and width and height control the size of the embedded frame. This is useful for displaying external maps, videos (like from YouTube), or entire web pages within your own.</li>
        </ol>

        <li><strong>Icons</strong></li>
        <p><blockquote>This HTML code demonstrates how to easily incorporate icons into a webpage using an external library called Font Awesome. 
            Instead of using image files, Font Awesome provides icons as special fonts. The key part is the <code>&lt;link&gt;</code> tag in the <code>&lt;head&gt;</code> section, 
            which connects your HTML file to Font Awesome's stylesheet (hosted online via a CDN). Once linked, you can display various icons by 
            using the <code>&lt;i&gt;</code> (italic) tag with specific class names (like fa-solid fa-house). This method is efficient because icons are scalable 
            like text and can be easily styled with CSS, making them a popular choice for navigation menus, social media links, and other visual cues on websites.</blockquote></p>

        <li><strong>Elements</strong></li>
        <p><blockquote>This HTML code teaches you how to create interactive forms on a webpage, which are used to collect information from users. 
            It showcases various input types like text fields, numbers, passwords, dates, radio buttons (for single choices), and checkboxes (for multiple choices). 
            You'll also see how to add labels (to describe input fields), text areas (for longer messages), buttons (to submit data or trigger actions), and dropdown lists (for predefined options). 
            All these elements are grouped within the main <code>&lt;form&gt;</code> tag, making it easy to build dynamic parts of a website where users can enter and send their data.</blockquote></p>

        <li><strong>Tables</strong></li>
        <p><blockquote>This HTML code demonstrates how to create tables for organizing data in rows and columns on a webpage.
           It starts with a simple table structure, showing how to use <code>&lt;table&gt;</code> as the container, <code>&lt;thead&gt;</code> for the header row, <code>&lt;tbody&gt;</code> for the body content, 
           <code>&lt;tr&gt;</code> for each table row, <code>&lt;th&gt;</code> for table headers (bold and centered by default), and <code>&lt;td&gt;</code> for table data (regular cells). The included CSS ensures the table has visible borders.
           <br />
           The code then illustrates two advanced features:</blockquote></p>
           <blockquote>
           <ul>
            <li>colspan: This attribute merges cells horizontally, allowing a single cell to span across multiple columns.</li>
            <li>rowspan: This attribute merges cells vertically, letting a single cell extend down through multiple rows.</li>
           </ul>
           <br />

        <li><strong>Strctural</strong></li>
         <p><blockquote>This HTML code provides a hands-on demonstration of structuring a webpage using various semantic and non-semantic HTML5 elements. 
        It starts with the versatile <code>&lt;div&gt;</code>  for general content grouping and <code>&lt;span&gt;</code> for inline styling. The code then introduces semantic tags like <nav> for
        navigation links, <code>&lt;header&gt;</code> for introductory content (often including navigation), and <code>&lt;footer&gt;</code>footer for copyright and contact information. Further down, 
        it demonstrates <code>&lt;section&gt;</code> to group related content, <code>&lt;article&gt;</code> for independent, self-contained content (like a blog post), <code>&lt;aside&gt;</code> for supplementary 
        content (like sidebars or related links), and <code>&lt;main&gt;</code> to define the dominant content of the <code>&lt;body&gt;</code>. Together, these elements are crucial for building 
        well-organized, accessible, and meaningful web layouts.</blockquote></p>

 </ul>


  <h1>CSS</h1>
  <p>CSS, or Cascading Style Sheets, is the language used to control how HTML content looks on a webpage. While HTML provides the structure (like the skeleton of a house), CSS is like the interior designer and painter. 
    It tells browsers about colors, fonts, spacing, layout, and overall visual presentation. With CSS, you can make text red, change font sizes, position elements on the page, add backgrounds, and even create animations. 
    It keeps your style rules separate from your HTML structure, making your code cleaner, easier to manage, and allowing you to change the look of an entire website from a single file.</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Inline CSS:* This is when you put style rules directly inside an HTML tag using the style attribute e.g., <code>&lt;style="color: blue;"&gt;</code>. It's quick for one-off changes but not great for larger projects.</li>
        <li>Internal CSS:* Styles are defined in a tag located within the section of the HTML document. </li>
        <li>External CSS:* This is the best method for most projects. You write all your CSS in a separate .css file and link it to your HTML document using a <code>&lt;link&gt;</code> tag in the <code>&lt;head&gt;</code>. This keeps your styles organized and lets you apply the same styles to many pages easily.</li>

        <li><strong>CSS Text</strong></li>
        <blockquote><p>This HTML code provides a hands-on guide to styling text using CSS (Cascading Style Sheets). It demonstrates properties for controlling font size, weight (boldness), and style (italic). You also learn to add text decorations (underline), transform text case (uppercase, lowercase), 
            and choose font families. The code covers setting text colors using various formats and adjusting line height, letter spacing, and word spacing for readability. Finally, it shows how to control text alignment and add text shadows. Essentially, this example illustrates how CSS is used to fully customize the visual appearance of all text on your webpage.</p>

        <li><strong>CSS Specificity</strong></li>
        <blockquote><p>CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is the language that makes your web content look good. It controls colors, fonts, layout, and more. When different CSS rules try to style the same part of your webpage, CSS Specificity acts like a tie-breaker, determining which style "wins." Rules with higher specificity override those with lower specificity. <br>The specificity hierarchy, from lowest to highest, is generally:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Element Selectors: (e.g., p, div) - Styles directly applied to HTML element names.</li>
            <li>Class Selectors: (e.g., .content) - Styles applied to elements with a specific class attribute.</li>
            <li>ID Selectors: (e.g., #main-content) - Styles applied to elements with a unique id attribute.</li>
            <li>Inline Styles: (e.g., style="background-color: purple;") - Styles written directly within the HTML tag itself. These are the most specific.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>In your example, the single <code>&lt;p&gt;</code> element has multiple conflicting background color rules:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>p selector: background-color: green; (Lowest specificity)</li>
            <li>.content selector: background-color: red;</li>
            <li>#main-content selector: background-color: blue;</li>
            <li>div p selector: background-color: yellow; (More specific than p alone)</li>
            <li>div .content selector: background-color: orange; (More specific than .content alone)</li>
            <li>div #main-content selector: background-color: aqua; (More specific than #main-content alone)</li>
            <li>#card #main-content selector: background-color: coral; (More specific than div #main-content because #card adds another ID to the chain)</li>
            <li>Inline Style: style="background-color: purple;" (Highest specificity)</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Because the inline style background-color: purple; is directly on the <code>&lt;p&gt;</code> tag, it has the highest specificity. Therefore, the paragraph will ultimately have a purple background. This demonstrates that inline styles always take precedence over all other CSS selector types for that specific property. Understanding specificity is key to troubleshooting why certain styles aren't applying as expected in your web projects.</p>

        <li><strong>CSS Selectors</strong></li>
        <blockquote><p>This HTML code, with its many commented CSS rules, demonstrates the various CSS Selectors used to target and style specific elements on a webpage. CSS itself is the language that controls how web content looks. The different selectors include element names (p), classes (.heading), IDs (#title), attributes (a[target="_blank"]), and relationships between elements like descendants (div p), children (div > p), and siblings (h2 + p, h1 ~ p). It also shows pseudo-classes (:hover, :first-child) for styling elements based on their state, and pseudo-elements (::first-letter, ::before) for styling parts of an element. Finally, grouping selectors (h1, h2) allow applying styles to multiple elements at once. Mastering these selectors is fundamental for precisely controlling your website's design.</p>

        <li><strong>CSS Margins</strong></li>
        <blockquote><p>This HTML code, along with its CSS, clearly demonstrates CSS Margins, which are used to create space around an HTML element, pushing it away from other elements on the page. The div element is given a border to make the spacing visible. The code shows how to set margins for all four sides at once (e.g., margin: 12px;), individually (e.g., margin-top: 20px;), or using shorthand notations for top/bottom and left/right, or top/right/bottom/left. Essentially, margins are key for controlling the external spacing between elements, helping you arrange them neatly on your webpage.</p>

        </blockquote>


        <li><strong>CSS Paddinng</strong></li>
        <blockquote><p>This HTML code, along with its CSS, demonstrates the fundamental concept of padding in CSS, which is used to create space inside an element's border, pushing content away from the edges. CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is the language that styles your web content, defining its appearance and layout.
        In this example, a div element is given a specific width, height, and border to make it visible. The padding: 12px; rule applies an equal padding of 12 pixels to all four sides (top, right, bottom, left) inside the div. This creates space between the div's border and the paragraph content (<code>&lt;p&gt;</code>Lorem ipsum...) within it.
        Think of padding as the "personal space" an element's content needs from its own boundary, while margins (as discussed before) create space between elements. Understanding padding is crucial for controlling the internal spacing and visual comfort of your content within its containers on a webpage</p>

        <li><strong>CSS Floating</strong></li>
        <blockquote><p>This HTML code, along with its CSS, demonstrates the float property, a classic CSS technique used to position elements, most commonly for wrapping text around an image. The <img> tag is styled with float: left; which pulls it to the left side of its container, allowing the subsequent paragraph text to flow and wrap neatly around its right side. An additional margin-right on the image ensures there's some space between the image and the surrounding text. While float was historically used for broader layouts, its main contemporary application is for this specific text-wrapping effect.</p>

        <li><strong>CSS Background </strong></li>
        <blockquote><p>This HTML code, along with its CSS, demonstrates how to control the background of a webpage using various CSS properties. It shows how to set a solid background color (background-color), create gradient backgrounds (background: linear-gradient), and use background images (background-image). Properties like background-repeat control if an image repeats, background-attachment determines if it scrolls or stays fixed, and background-size: cover; ensures the image fills the entire background area. Ultimately, this code teaches you how to visually enhance your webpages with diverse and dynamic backgrounds.</p>

        <li><strong>CSS Borders</strong></li>
        <blockquote><p>This HTML code, along with its CSS, demonstrates how to add and customize borders around HTML elements, which is a fundamental aspect of webpage design controlled by CSS (Cascading Style Sheets). The example shows a paragraph (<p>) and a div element, both styled with borders. You can control a border's style (e.g., solid), width (e.g., 5px), and color (e.g., blue) individually or using a convenient shorthand property like border: 3px solid blue;. Additionally, the code illustrates box-shadow to add a shadow effect behind the element and border-radius to create rounded corners, allowing you to soften the element's appearance. Essentially, these CSS properties give you precise control over the visual boundaries and subtle depth of your webpage elements.</p>

        </blockquote>


        <li><strong>CSS Box Model</strong></li>
        <blockquote><p>This HTML code, combined with its CSS, vividly illustrates the CSS Box Model, a fundamental concept explaining how every HTML element is treated as a rectangular box on a webpage. This box comprises four layers, from innermost to outermost: the content itself (your text), padding (space inside the border, pushing content away from the edges), the border (the visible line around the element), and margin (space outside the border, pushing the element away from other elements). Understanding this model, as shown with the div's defined padding, border, and margin, is crucial for precisely controlling the size, spacing, and positioning of all elements in your web layouts.</p>
            <p>Visual Representation of the Box Model </p><pre>

        <li><strong>CSS Units</strong></li>
        <blockquote><p>This HTML code demonstrates CSS Units, which define sizes and measurements on webpages. It showcases two types:</p>
    <ul>
    <li>Absolute Units: Like pixels (px), centimeters (cm), millimeters (mm), and inches (in), which have fixed physical sizes and are less adaptable.</li>
    <li>Relative Units: Like percentages (%), em (relative to parent's font size), rem (relative to root font size), viewport width (vw), and viewport height (vh). These units scale dynamically, making them crucial for creating responsive web designs that adapt to different screen sizes.</li></ul>
    <p>Essentially, this code explains how to choose the right measurement unit to control the sizing and responsiveness of elements on your website.</p>

    <li><strong>CSS Positions</strong></li>
    <blockquote><p>This HTML code, with its CSS, demonstrates CSS Positioning, a key concept for controlling element placement on a webpage. Each position value dictates how an element behaves:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>static: The default, elements appear in normal flow.</li>
        <li>relative: Moves an element from its normal spot but keeps its space in the flow; crucial for positioning absolute children.</li>
        <li>absolute: Removes an element from the flow, positioning it relative to its closest positioned parent or the viewport.</li>
        <li>fixed: Also removes an element from the flow, but it stays fixed relative to the viewport, even when scrolling.</li>
        <li>sticky: A hybrid that acts relative until a certain scroll point, then becomes fixed.</li>

    <li><strong>CSS Important</strong></li>
    <blockquote><p>This HTML code, along with its CSS, demonstrates the !important rule in CSS, which is used to override even the highest specificity rules when styling an element. CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) dictates how your web content looks, and normally, styles are applied based on selector specificity (ID > Class > Element) and order.</p>
    <p>However, when !important is added to a CSS property declaration (e.g., color: red !important;), it gives that specific rule the highest possible priority, overriding all other conflicting styles for that property, including inline styles.This HTML code, along with its CSS, demonstrates the !important rule in CSS, which is used to override even the highest specificity rules when styling an element. CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) dictates how your web content looks, and normally, styles are applied based on selector specificity (ID > Class > Element) and order.

However, when !important is added to a CSS property declaration (e.g., color: red !important;), it gives that specific rule the highest possible priority, overriding all other conflicting styles for that property, including inline styles.

In your example, the <code>&lt;h1&gt;</code> element has multiple conflicting color rules:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Element Selector (h1): color: red !important;</li>
    <li>Class Selector (.title): color: green !important;</li>
    <li>D Selector (#main-title): color: blue;</li>
    <li>Inline Style: style="color: orange"</li></ul>

CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) dictates how your web content looks, and normally, styles are applied based on selector specificity (ID > Class > Element) and order.

Element Selector (h1): color: red !important;
Class Selector (.title): color: green !important;
ID Selector (#main-title): color: blue;
Inline Style: style="color: orange"
Even though inline styles usually have the highest specificity, both the h1 and .title rules have !important. When multiple !important rules conflict, specificity (ID > Class > Element) still applies among them. In this case, since both h1 and .title target the element, the .title (class selector) has higher specificity than h1 (element selector) among the !important rules. Therefore, the <code>&lt;h1&gt;</code> element's text will ultimately be green.
While !important is powerful for forcing styles, it's generally recommended to use it sparingly as it can make CSS harder to manage and debug due to its overriding nature.

     <li><strong>CSS Flexbox</strong></li>

    <p>This HTML code, along with its CSS, demonstrates CSS Flexbox, a powerful and efficient layout model for arranging items in a single row or column. CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is used to control the visual presentation and layout of web elements.
The key to Flexbox is the display: flex; property applied to a container (in this case, div.container). This turns the container into a flex container and its direct children (.box elements) into flex items. Flexbox then provides properties to control how these items are laid out:</p>
<ul>
    <li>flex-direction: Defines the main axis, setting the direction in which flex items are placed (e.g., row for horizontal, column for vertical, or their reverse versions).</li>
    <li>justify-content: Aligns items along the main axis (e.g., flex-start, flex-end, center, space-between, space-around, space-evenly).</li>
    <li>align-items: Aligns items along the cross axis (perpendicular to the main axis) within a single line (e.g., flex-start, flex-end, center, stretch).</li>
    <li>flex-wrap: Controls whether flex items should wrap onto multiple lines if they exceed the container's size (e.g., wrap allows wrapping, nowrap keeps them on one line).</li>
    <li>align-content: Aligns multiple lines of wrapped flex items along the cross axis when there's extra space (only visible when flex-wrap is active).</li>
    <li>gap (or row-gap, column-gap): Creates space between flex items, simplifying spacing compared to using margins.</li>
</ul><p>By using Flexbox, you can easily create responsive and dynamic layouts that adapt to different screen sizes and content, making it a cornerstone of modern web design.</p>

    <li><strong>CSS Transitions</strong></li>
    <blockquote><p>This HTML code demonstrates CSS Transitions, a powerful feature for creating smooth, animated changes to an element's style. Instead of an abrupt change, a transition allows a style to change gradually over a specified duration. The core of CSS transitions involves a few key properties:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>transition-property: Specifies which CSS property to animate (e.g., background-color, transform).</li>
        <li>transition-duration: Sets how long the transition should take.</li>
        <li>transition-timing-function: Defines the speed curve of the transition (e.g., ease, linear, ease-in-out).</li>
        <li>transition-delay: Adds a delay before the transition begins.</li>
        <li>Shorthand Property: These can be combined into one line like transition: background-color 1s ease-in-out 2s;.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>In your examples, a button's background color smoothly changes on hover, a circle animates its color, size, and position, an image scales and rotates on hover, and a heading's opacity fades in. This shows how transitions can be applied to almost any CSS property to create engaging and dynamic user interfaces.</p>

    <li><strong>CSS Grid</strong></li>
    <blockquote><p>This HTML code, with its CSS, demonstrates CSS Grid, a modern layout system for creating two-dimensional page designs with rows and columns. The key is to set display: grid; on the container. You then use grid-template-columns to define the size and number of columns and gap to add space between the grid items. Grid is ideal for building complex, responsive layouts, making it a powerful tool for modern web development.</p>

    <li><strong>CSS animations</strong></li>
    <blockquote><p>This HTML code demonstrates CSS Animations, a powerful feature for creating smooth, multi-step visual effects. CSS is what controls how a webpage looks. The process has two main parts:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Defining the Animation: Using the @keyframes rule, you define what the animation does at different stages (e.g., 0%, 50%, 100%).</li>
        <li>Applying the Animation: You link the animation to an element with the animation property. This property sets the animation's name, duration, how many times it runs (iteration-count), and other timing details.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>Essentially, this code shows you how to bring elements to life by defining a sequence of style changes and then applying that sequence to an element on your webpage.</p>

<li><strong>Media Queries</strong></li>
<blockquote><p>This HTML code, with its CSS, demonstrates Media Queries, a key feature for creating responsive web designs. Media queries let you apply different styles to a webpage based on the screen's characteristics, such as its width. In this example, the heading and paragraph have a default style. However, if the screen is under 399px wide (like a phone), the heading and paragraph styles change. A separate rule changes the heading's style again if the screen is between 500px and 800px wide (like a tablet). This method ensures your website looks good and functions well on any device.</p>

<li><strong>Bootstrap Integration</strong></li>
<blockquote><p>This HTML code shows how to use Bootstrap, a popular framework, to build modern, responsive webpages quickly. Instead of writing all the CSS yourself, you simply add Bootstrap's pre-built classes to your HTML elements. The code includes a navigation bar, a variety of buttons, and a pop-up modal, all styled and functional right out of the box. This makes web development much faster and easier, especially for ensuring your site looks great on any device.</p>

 <h1>JavaScript(js)</h1>
<p>JavaScript is a programming language that makes websites interactive and dynamic. While HTML gives a webpage its structure (the content and layout) and CSS handles the styling (colors and fonts), JavaScript adds the behavior and functionality. Think of it as the "action" of a webpage. For example, JavaScript is what makes a button clickable, validates form data before it's submitted, powers animations like slideshows, or fetches new information without needing to reload the entire page. It runs directly inside a user's web browser, which is why it's so fundamental to modern web development.</p>
